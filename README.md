This Inventory Management System is a desktop application built using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. It showcases Java, Object-Oriented Programming, and User Interface Design. The application is designed to manage inventory efficiently, allowing users to add, modify, delete, and search for parts and products.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern was implemented. The Model handles the core business logic and data management, the View is responsible for the user interface and presentation using JavaFX, and the Controller acts as the intermediary, managing user input and updating both the Model and View to ensure seamless interaction.
